You might already know how to
horizontally center text

00:00:02.818 --> 00:00:04.206
using text-align: center.

00:00:05.468 --> 00:00:07.468
But did you know you can also center

00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:09.619
an entire paragraph vertically
using align-content?

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:13.095
Check that the parent element
is set to display: block.

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:16.507
When align-content is set to center,

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:18.809
the entire paragraph gets
centered vertically

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:20.834
as long as its parent has 
extra space in it.

00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.076
And this isn't even just for text.

00:00:24.764 --> 00:00:26.764
This works on other elements too

00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:28.788
as long as their parent is set to
display: block.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:31.915
Because this feature is new,

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:34.325
this would only work on newer browsers.

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:37.523
But you can use it already
because it is in Baseline now.

00:00:38.132 --> 00:00:39.957
Just ensure that your layout

00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:42.417
is still usable even when it isn't
vertically centered.
