00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.300
Every year, new features
are added to HTML, CSS, at JavaScript.

00:00:04.824 --> 00:00:08.224
But of course, these can't be
immediately used on production websites

00:00:08.248 --> 00:00:10.248
because browsers don't
immediately support them.

00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:14.372
Baseline is a metric
found in resources

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:16.396
like MDN Web Docs and web.dev.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.420
When a feature reaches
Baseline Newly Available,

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:23.444
it means that latest browsers
already support it.

00:00:23.468 --> 00:00:25.768
You can now use it on websites

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.170
as long as you have a fallback
for older browsers.

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:31.352
"Fallback" is an alternative
experience

00:00:31.377 --> 00:00:33.143
so users can still use your website

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:35.167
even on older browsers.

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:38.188
For example, in 2024,

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.011
latest browsers already support subgrid.

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.508
This is CSS Grid level 2,

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:44.373
and with this,

00:00:44.397 --> 00:00:45.669
elements can now inherit

00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:47.018
the grid properties set

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:48.470
on their parent element.

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.715
Subgrid will work on the latest browsers,

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.675
but your layout might break on
older versions.

00:00:55.647 --> 00:00:57.329
How can we provide fallback?

00:00:58.374 --> 00:01:01.104
In CSS, we can use feature queries.

00:01:01.713 --> 00:01:04.022
It works similarly to
media queries,

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.807
but instead of querying
the size of the browser viewport,

00:01:07.218 --> 00:01:08.828
it queries for whether the browser

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:10.431
has support for a new feature.

00:01:11.527 --> 00:01:13.527
Before we use subgrid, let's build

00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:15.551
a layout for all browser
tayo ng layout para sa lahat ng browsers na

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:16.944
that don't support subgrid first.

00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:19.711
This is your fallback,
or in other words,

00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:22.018
default styling for all browsers.

00:01:22.622 --> 00:01:24.923
Let's then use a feature query

00:01:24.947 --> 00:01:27.645
to ask the browser whether
it supports subgrid.

00:01:28.453 --> 00:01:30.453
If not,

00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:31.675
everything here gets ignored.

00:01:33.108 --> 00:01:34.631
Inside the feature query,

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:36.833
we can put all the styles related to

00:01:36.857 --> 00:01:39.031
the new layout that uses subgrid.

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:42.980
Default styles will
apply for all browsers

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.777
But in newer browsers

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:45.968
with support for subgrid

00:01:46.246 --> 00:01:48.174
fallback styles will be
overriden by styles

00:01:48.198 --> 00:01:49.968
inside the feature query.
